Equally, within our own personal lives, we have stories of failure and eventual success. Historically, successful leaders such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos serve as reminders that while failure can be disheartening, it is not the end of the road. Therefore, this essay will explore why failure is necessary for eventual success. Churchill served in the military, where he was a failure, and suffered defeats in politics. Nonetheless, he made the leap of faith and invested everything he had into launching Amazon. Resilience Overcomes Failure V. These stories often involve resilience over time. Conclusion Draft: Success is the goal of many, and yet is often a long and arduous journey. And the rest is history: Amazon quickly rose to become one of the largest companies in the world. Similarly, stories of personal failure and eventual success are ubiquitous. The common denominator is often resilience. If one aspires to success, then it is important to consider one's own relationship to failure. This essay seeks to explore why failure is necessary for eventual success. Outline: I. Historical Examples: Winston Churchill, Jeff Bezos III. Bezos famously took a huge risk in 1996 when he resigned from his highly successful job in finance, with no clear plan for what followed. Introduction II. Sir Winston Churchill, a celebrated statesman, once said, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts\". This inspiring sentiment speaks to the power of perseverance, a sentiment the many successful people of today undoubtedly embody. Take for example, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Sir Winston Churchill famously said, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts\". This quotation speaks to the power of courage and perseverance, values that are echoed in both famous and personal stories of success. Whether it be a friend who failed out of school yet eventually graduated with honors, or a family member who failed to launch a business only to eventually achieve success with their second venture. Historical examples such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos demonstrate how failure is often a catalyst for eventual success. But, despite the discouragement, Churchill applied his courage and press. Personal Stories of Failure and Success."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course that I'm agree with Churchill's statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!. The failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example: In the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, don't stop just try it again and try do it better the next time. For a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, don't matter, you will find another job, just don't loss the enthusiasm. In a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or what's more worse she/he doesn't like you, don't be sad you will find the right one for you. In a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, don't loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it. In the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when it's not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and that't a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesn't. Be successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary it's hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me \"Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, don't matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm\". I think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You don't need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesn't mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, it's mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No one is perfect and you don't need to be it for be successful. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent don't matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want. In conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: \"Each failure it's make you more strong and more intelligent\", and the truth that's true, you never gonna learn about your error if you don't have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm."}]}

When setting goals to a higher level, there are clear benefits that can be seen compared to setting goals to a low level. Goals provide clarity, set expectations and can help keep someone on track and focused on their end goal. For many people who want to achieve something significant in life, setting goals is a crucial step in the effort of reaching that success. Furthermore, challenging goals can provide someone with a variety of intellectual, physical, and emotional experiences that will be beneficial in the long run. Reaching higher level objectives can also open up the possibility to more, as putting extra effort into a task or achieving a goal that seems extreme can open up myriad of other opportunities that one may not have had access to before. Doing so can help one reach to the top without sacrificing too much and experiencing the most benefit. In this way, one can find growth in all aspects and gain knowledge that will remain with them for a lifetime. Moreover, if the goal is too far out of reach, it can lead to a sense of failure and an unwillingness to keep striving towards the goal. Overall, setting goals to a higher level provides one with more growth and a greater sense of success compared to setting goals at a lower level. When setting these objectives, it is important to consider the level of difficulty and the expected growth one will experience. Achieving more difficult goals can not only provide a sense of success and pride, but also can give validation to progress made and a sense of growth. However, it is important to note that this type of growth comes with a certain cost. Setting higher level goals can require extra focus, time, energy, and other resources that may have a financial or emotional consequence. On the other hand, it is important to keep a sense of balance when setting goals as to not end up overwhelmed or taken aback if the goal is out of reach. Growth in terms of experiences, awareness, and knowedge."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "These people view failing as a discouragement as others may consider them as a weak. However, aiming high and failing gives you a life-longing experience by having the chance to improve your mistakes. In my opinion, I agree with Michelangelo's quote; when people aim too low, they are preventing themselves to have learning experiences. When attempting again, you will have gained the knowledge to do so. In conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low and achieving it is far worse than aiming high and failing. Although one may fail while aiming high, you will gain experience and knowledge from the situation. To begin with, growth comes with attempting to accomplish new things out of your comfort zone. Being the valedictorian comes with great results such as getting into a better college or even just feeling better about yourself. The famous artist Michelangelo once said, \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark\". His quote implies that completing a low goal is far worse that failure. When setting you aim high, it improves you as a person and helps with your own growth. Not to mention, aiming high for a goal is possible when you have the right mentality. When you aim high, the results are more motivating than when going for a goal set low. Instead, they believe that going for a goal set too high is worse as it means it will come with failure. Failing is essential to the learning process as it gives you a chance to better yourself to prevent future mistakes. By setting goals too low, we are preventing ourselves to grow and improve. You can learn about your interests and hobbies, or even new ideas and thoughts that come to mind. For instance, when working towards a goal, it comes with finding your true self. If you put your mind to it, belive in yourself, and work hard towards it you will be able to accomplish any goal. Furthermore, failing at achieving a goal provides experience. By setting goals to a higher level, we can gain experience and knowledge that comes with the path to achievement. For the fact that we need to grow as a person, we can not always stay in our comfort zone. For instance, when achieving to graduate high school, one may aim to graduate as valedictorian. In order to succeed the next time you attempt again, you can improve your mistakes. When you set your aim high, it assists with finding out what you are truly capable of. Because aiming high comes with better resluts, it can serve as motivation to completing a goal. On the other hand, when you aim for a low mark, there is no learning lesson you may gain. However, some people believe nothing is wrong with setting your aim low. While always staying in your comfort zone, aiming low, you will be confining yourself, which prevents you from improvement. This knowledge you have accumulated from this certain situation, will be useful if applied to other life problems. When you fail, you can use that situation to understand where you went wrong. In order for growth and improvement, one must be required to step out off their comfort zone."}]}

There are many ways to achieve the important goal of remaining true to oneself. Being kind and respectful of different backgrounds and beliefs can help a person feel connected to others. It can be easy to fall into the trap of believing that we must fit these outside expectations in order to be accepted. Ultimately, it is important to recognize the value of being yourself and the benefits it will bring. Most importantly, it is essential to be mindful of one's thought process so they can focus on self-love and acceptance instead of internalizing any unwanted pressures from society. However, it is important to know that no one should have to change who they are to please someone else. One of the best things a person can do is to surround themselves with supportive people who will accept them for who they are. Social media, magazines, television, and other modern forms of communication reinforce ideas about who we should be, telling us one thing yet pressuring us to act another way. By maintaining an attitude of self-love and acceptance, one can develop the strength to be themselves even in the face of other people's opinions. Being yourself is essential for good mental health. There is great strength and courage in being true to oneself and overcoming the pressures of society. An individual should also be mindful of the thoughts they have and how they perceive others.

At the end of your days you will be really thankful to you because you live life the way that you are, not the way that others wanted you to be. It was just obstacles that maked your life more stressful and harder but you did it. For example the LGBT community get a lot of hate, judge and bad things from other people that is not part of it. You got all the things that you wanted and the most important was, to be yourself. People in this world just talk about others without thinking the pain that they can cause by saying just a few simple words. They will never be satisfied, they will judge you, they will talk bad things about you, but at the end it's just a obstacle that the life put in your way, so you can surpass it and finally find yourself and be how you are. To be yourself in this actual world it's difficult for some people because sometimes they don't support the judges from other people and most of this people just decide to end with their life. You will think in all the things that you have to supported and achieved just to get your goal, to be who you are and at end you will knew that it wasn't hard. Other example is the people from other country that travel to another, there are people that are racist and make people feel that they are from another world, when they are actually they same, the only thing that change is the culture and language. To be yourself in a world that is contantly trying to make you something else is one of the most important things that people have to achieve, to live the life better because you will never progress in your emotional life if you don't make people accept the way that you are. For teenagers to be theirselves is most difficult because they are in a young age and sometimes they don't really know how they are or how they want to be, and when they finally find it, the hard part is coming. You have to fight to achieve this because life is better if you do it, is better if you don't care about others comments, you will be more stronger than before if you fight with all this situations. You will be more happy and will have a great life if you are yourself, you will be more certain about your opinions, decisions and actions. Then for older people, most of them don't care what people say about them, I have seen a lot of older people that dress and make to their selves what they want and I really like to see them because it makes me to be less insecure about myself, they just make me think a lot. Live the life by showing how you are, the opinion of other people doesn't have to make you more insecure or make you think that if you do this or other things you will get judged or hated. To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment because at the day of today there's a lot people that doesn't want to accept the way that you are or you want to be."}]}

Indeed, ‘being yourself’ in less than ideal conditions can be the ‘greatest accomplishment’ of all. And those who are seen as ‘different’ – whether because of their personal preferences, physical appearance, or anything else – often have to battle against negative stereotypes in order to remain true to themselves. Despite these difficulties, however, it is possible to be yourself, even in difficult situations. It is a difficult but ultimately rewarding feat, one which is worthy of celebration and acknowledgement. The struggles of being yourself can often be compounded for immigrant populations, teenagers, and those who are considered ‘different’. By remaining true to your authentic self, you can stay confident and maintain your integrity, even when facing adversity. In a world filled with expectations, it can be difficult to remain true to oneself. For example, immigrant families often have to deal with different cultures, expectations, and norms, which can make it hard for them to stay true to their identity and beliefs. For example, it can be beneficial to surround oneself with people who can support, encourage and motivate you to be your true self, free from judgement. Through these means, it is possible to stick to your values and be your true self in spite of any pressure to conform. Teenagers, in particular, frequently have to face peer pressure to conform to certain standards and ideals, which again can make it difficult to be their authentic selves."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone. I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly. Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong. Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. I am agree with the Emerson's statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself. it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it."}]}

This philosophy has served me well throughout my life, and is something I encourage everyone to embrace. I have always viewed my problems as a chance for me to do my best.

In conclusion, while educators and students view long summer vacations differently, both can benefit from this extended break. Summer is a special season for both students and educators. These activities provide students with valuable experience and potentially a source of income. It is also a period for catch-up work, such as lesson planning and grading, which may not be possible during the school year when teaching time takes priority. Students generally enjoy summer vacation because it's a break from schoolwork and everyday obligations, allowing them to take some time for themselves. Furthermore, the summer offers the perfect opportunity to pursue an extra activity, like an internship, or a summer job. On one hand, many students look forward to long summer vacation as a chance to relax, have fun, and explore new activities; many educators, however, view summer vacation as a well-deserved break from the classroom that allows them to spend more time away from the pressures of their jobs. For me, summer vacation has always been a wonderful opportunity to pursue creative projects and spend quality time with family and friends. During this period, students have adequate time for leisure activities like visiting friend’s house, going shopping, playing games, etc. Students use the time to explore and try new things, while educators are able to recharge and catch up on tasks that didn’t happen during the school year.

Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I couln't do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us would't provide the same amount of aventures. More over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldn't make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. Most student enjoy summer vacations, but some educators believe that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig.

Summer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. What educators don't see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. It can sound exagerate but that wouldn't be much time to us for do our sumer change. First of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the \"suffer\" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the one's who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. I beliebe that we things shouldn't change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students who's choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school. On the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times don't remenber thing that I sow the year before. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year."}]}

Firstly, a curfew can have an especially positive effect on families. By requiring teenagers to be in their homes by a certain time of night, this decreases the chances of teens participating in illegal activities, such as underage drinking and drug use. As teens comply with a curfew, this ensures that they are able to attend school on time and refreshed and are better able to focus and achieve their academic goals. As teens have a greater sense of structure and security, this encourages stronger communities to form within a society. Curfews can also help to ensure that children are completing their homework and getting adequate rest, leading to positive relationships between families. Teenagers have curfews set in place, families can feel more secure that their children are in safe environments and are not engaging in risky activities. In conclusion, the enforcement of curfews for teenagers can have a range of positive impacts, from a more secure family environment to a stronger school culture. Enforcing a curfew for teenagers can have numerous positive impacts that ripple throughout families, local government, society, and schools. Curfews can also help to ensure that teens are not disrupting their local neighborhoods with loud music or unruly behavior after dark. The positive impacts of enforcing curfews for teenagers can also be felt more broadly in society. Similarly, it helps to decrease traffic related incidents which can have considerable impacts on a local community. As a result, setting curfews can be an effective tool in helping teenagers to stay safe, secure, and academically successful.

That rule can be very strict for some people, but that is after a long analyze the best way to put our teenagers safe. Because teenager are the principal target of people in the street because they are easily influenced. When the parent stay at home with their children that can help them to planning the schedule of the sleeping period to be the optimal version of parent of their children. Because the first priority of a teenager is school and they can have time for studying, that decision can create the future amazing men and women in the future for emergence of our city. That create an enormous positives and negatives reactions the rabble who is for the curfew and who disagree this and said we are in a free country. For example, when the parents know where their children are that can help them to stay calm. This laws prohibit to see a teenager on the street at 10 P.M weekday and midnight weekend. In this prompt we will show the reason why the curfew can be a marvelous benefit for teenagers and keep them out of trouble. In beginning, the decision is reassuring for the parents. A city council is debating for the adoption of the curfew for teenagers. The beneficial effect what can impact our the families situations, the local authority, the society and in school, or class. the idea there is to leave a parent with their children to help them to be close and to know each other. The curfew can assure the best future for the children in our city and United State of America. This easily influenced can associate them with a sort of people disreputable. In auditioning, the curfew can help a teenagers in their education. We have immensity and variety of people in our street like drugs dealer, a daring, and a rabble we do not go to let our children walking in this environment at night. In other case, the law can heaven preserve them from eventual aggression in the minor. To have a marvelous performance at test and at class we need to sleep the time recommend by a specialist. Because everyone know that most of the crime are commit at night and that can not be the moment where we leave our teenagers outside. In this case, that can help teenagers to sleep early. For example that will help the 911 to reduce call for emergency at night. In this case, the law can decrease a criminality rate in the street."}]}

A positive outlook enables us to realize that failure is not always the end of the story, and that often it is possible to learn and grow even in the face of adversity. Third, there is a big difference between positive and negative attitudes. Rather than wallowing in self-doubt or giving up when faced with difficulty, a positive attitude encourages us to have faith in our own abilities and take action. When we view interactions with others in a positive light, we are more likely to understand their point of view and approach them with empathy and kindness. This in turn can make it easier to find solutions to difficult problems rather than viewing them as insurmountable challenges.

Staying busy, but also taking time to relax, reflect, and practice self-care will help to balance a person’s mental, physical, and emotional health along with their ability to reach their goals. After all, if we’re not striving for some type of progress, then we become stagnant and unmotivated. In addition, having time to relax, reflect, and practice self-care can help to recharge and better manage stress. However, there are times when taking a step back and slowing down is beneficial. Thomas Jefferson believed that staying busy and staying productive are important aspects of a successful life. However, taking occasional breaks, when appropriate, can help to enhance the productivity achieved and foster self-reflection. In conclusion, it is important to stay busy and productive for a fulfilled and meaningful life. For those of us who prefer keeping busy, there are several advantages to this approach. Prioritizing activities and understanding when it is beneficial to take a break can help to ensure that tasks are completed gradually and with fewer mistakes. For him, the sense of fulfillment and purpose that he achieved through productive work meant that he was able to achieve meaningful things and better understand life. Oftentimes, taking a break from an activity can lead to new insights and perspectives that can make productivity more effective. Overall, striking the right balance between staying busy and being in-active can help to maximize productivity and improve the quality of one's life.

To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected. We all have our different ways of living and learning. One way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being in-active is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future. In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy. Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldn't be the case for all. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week so I didn't have to do anything in the weekend. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"Determine never to be idle...\" Being unprepared isn't the best way to live. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sister's sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sol's to focus on. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn. Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. Having more free time can have it's positive outcomes, but also its negatives."}]}

However, while these benefits are worth considering, there are some potential inconveniences that cannot be ignored. For one thing, a shorter summer break would drastically reduce the amount of free time students would have to explore rest and relaxation activities, and contribute to their own personal growth. As the school year winds down each year, a summer break of three months beckons. On one hand, proponents of shortening summer break argue that the extra time in the classroom will lead to better academic performance, as students will have more opportunities to learn and apply their knowledge. Before deciding whether to reduce time off in the summer, it is important to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a drastic change in schedule. Therefore, reducing the length of summer break should not be considered at this time. Additionally, an extended school year often leaves less time for students to spend with friends and family, diminishing important social interaction needed for optimal mental and physical health. It has also been suggested that reducing summer vacation can lead to a decrease in the summer learning slump, as students' minds remain sharp and engaged year-round. Reducing the length of summer break, though often met with resistance, has been proposed as a solution to some of the educational system's current issues. Overall, while it may appear that the pros of shortening summer vacation could greatly benefit the educational system, the negatives that come with it should also be taken into account. Taking away time from optimal physical and mental activity, and reducing the ability for students to develop outside the classroom, can be detrimental in the long term."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. If you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there. For example, if you live in Virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to Florida or any other place. Other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. It is best to just keep it the way it has always been. Most schools have three months of a break and people are used to having a three month long summer break, so there will be a lot of arguments into why change it now. Being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. A long summer break means more fun and less stress. To have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer. Finally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. Most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. Most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. Also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. For example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. Having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation. Another reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. Schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. Being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. You will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. I do not think this is a good idea. Even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students. Educators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. After failing tests, having bad grades, your parents yelling at you for it, pressuring you to do better, and having other things to deal with that will make you have stress. It is important for students to be able to have a long summer break so they can get their minds off in a lot things and have less stress. Overall, having a long summer break means people will run out of things to do there should still be a long break because people go on vacations a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and it reduces stress for students. For example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. Having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things. Having long summer breaks also results in a lot of solutions for people."}]}

Heroes tend to be brave, noble, and just-those traits often being part of what makes them heroic.

In conclusion, character traits are an essential part of storytelling and can have a profound influence on how characters are portrayed and how stories progress. Selecting the right character traits can be key to creating an emotionally engaging story that resonates with readers. From the earliest stories of humanity, characters have been one of the most important aspects of storytelling. Character traits, such as bravery or generosity, are the fundamental building blocks of any great character. Likewise, villains are often shown to be cowardly, selfish, and cruel-traits that mark them as the antagonists. Character traits also often act as moral indicators. Without these traits, his adventures may have been less exciting, and perhaps may have even ended differently. By choosing the right traits for our characters, we can ensure that our stories will be interesting, engaging, and meaningful. His unwavering courage and wit are the main driving forces behind his successes and ultimately help him achieve his goals. As a brave, determined, and shrewd adventurer, Odysseus is able to survive many of his confrontations with mythical creatures and adversaries. This is true not only in literature, but also in everyday life. Furthermore, displaying appropriate character traits in everyday life can be beneficial in displaying one’s own moral code and character.

Next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. For insist, White tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show. Choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. Which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. Unfourtely that some character traits can't be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits. For example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty, helpful, caring, little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. But their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. Why, let me tell you; every on has their own unique traits even the traits they get from their parent. Therfore I always said \"Character trait can be beautiful but a curse in disguise\". As poof that I do have my mom's gene meaning I have her physical look. It is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. Same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents' character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parent's traits. Although, I explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait , animal, lastly the price of choosing character trait. \"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it\". Therefore, in my opinion character traits can be chose but it must show as true self that represent you. lastly animal spirit do show has traits that represent as our character traits. Character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse. As you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. For example, It remind me the time when I am all dressed up and got my hair done after that I look at the mirror; I notice that I look familiar at the time I realized that I look like mom. My opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. Anyway not a problem. You can choose which character traits, sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. That I truly believe that everyone has the right to chose their own character traits then having someone influences them to have the same character trait as them then having your own traits. For example if the person has the character trait which is playful, love water, caring, and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. Therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. Although, I do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path. Everyone has their own unique traits.

However, I had seen some students who used their cellphone during classes. Amazon has a strong impact of sales in the world, Their sales are more high than any other stores. I believe that the life is so short to waste. In the final analyses technology will keep going to destroy our cultures. I believed that technology has negative effects on people's lives because people have a limitation of a human contact due to the use of technology. Technology limited the develop of ideas.Technology limited our communication, our knowledge, our curiosity, and our happiness. She was saying that sometimes our lives depend on a cell device, but not all the time. When I did not understand some difficult words I used Google translated, so technology helped us sometime. They have this issue due to the use of technology. Local store is about to close because people prefer to stay at home and buy online. My point of view is that what she told me was true because I came to United Stated of America since 2016; I was not be able to understand or speak to others. Their sales had exceed on online store than in the located stores. Also it had destroyed our culture. Technology helps us to communicate with our families and friends. However, there are to many ways such as painting, drawing, playing even dancing. Example I am a member of a dance class, my teacher was talking about this problem with technology. Children do not read books or have fun like in the past. Some people prefer to buy their materials or clothes online stores as Amazon. Children want to stay at home playing with their laptops. He always is with his cell phone playing. My point of view is technology have a really negative effect on us because it had changed us, our world. He does not read any book and neither go outside to play. Additionally people who work in this stores are going to have a layoff due to this matter. Another reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that some places are empty namely: Parks, lakes, and malls. everything in this world is going to be different. Students are distracted with their cell phone at schools. It limited the growth of children because, they do not want to go outside to play with their friends. People will not go outside at all, to buy, to have fun, or to spend time with their families. In fact this generation do not read books or magazine because of the technology."}]}

By having the ability to choose our own path, we can be empowered to seek out the best opportunities available to us and create a future that is full of possibility. While it is often a common expectation to follow in the footsteps of someone else, such as our parents, it is important to recognize that our lives are our own and that if we want to pursue something different, then we should be allowed to do so. Making your own decisions is essential for a healthy and prosperous life. This is one of the most important decisions we make in life, and one that many of us delegate to others. While most of us are predisposed to stick with the status quo, including ideas and beliefs that have been passed down to us from previous generations, it is only when we make our own decisions that we are able to critically evaluate any potential risks or rewards associated with our decisions. When we have the freedom and autonomy to make decisions, we gain a sense of self-ownership and control over our destiny. Making our own decisions on relocation opens up a world of possibilities, allowing us to explore new experiences and discover what brings us true happiness and success. This customizing of our mental framework leads to greater self-awareness and enables us to make informed decisions. Take marriage as an example. When we make our own decisions about who we marry, or even if we don’t marry, we can ensure that the individual we select is a genuine partner, on whom we can depend. Overall, making your own decisions is a fundamental aspect of an enriching and fulfilling life, and when we take control of our destiny, we can shape our lives to our satisfaction.

He did not simply wait for his goals to come to fruition; instead, he was actively involved in every step of the creation process, from in-depth market research to detailed product testing and design. In contrast, there are those who fail to reach their dreams because they do not strive to actively pursue their goals. For example, many aspiring entrepreneurs will not risk their financial security in order to invest in their ideas, as they are not motivated to work towards their dreams. To illustrate this idea, we can consider the example of Steve Jobs: an ambitious man who sought to revolutionize the world of technology. To put it simply: having an active attitude of determination and ambition can truly bring success. Thomas Jefferson once famously declared that \"nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude\". His words have a powerful resonance in our present day, for it is clear that those who act on their dreams and goals can achieve far more than those who do not. Those who do not have a clear focus do not tend to be willing to make sacrifices or take risks to push themselves further. They will create tangible plans, allowing them to establish deadlines and strides in reaching their goals. Achieving one’s ambitions does not come easy, and for those willing to work hard, the rewards can be great. When examining individuals who actively strive to reach their ambitions, the key component is the clear focus on their objectives."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But you can get all this if you work hard and. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things Finally, be related everyday this is something special. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. Thomas Jefferson said. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something \"I need to struggle\". Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related. However noeveryone agree. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen. In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Because you always are looking for something more than one. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. But he always said this words \"one day everything is going to change\". He never stop to belived that. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament."}]}

Ultimately, attempting to do something beyond what you have already mastered not only helps you to grow but is also important to reaching your goals and achieving success. All of these skills are important for leading a successful life. In conclusion, attempting to do something beyond what you have already mastered can help you grow in ways that you may have never expected. This desire to take on something new can be a valuable tool to help us grow and develop. One example of this is in the world of athletics. Taking on something that you may not have done before also helps you to gain confidence in your abilities, build trust in yourself, and even to become a better problem solver. Athletes are constantly looking to take their existing skills to the next level by adding a new one. By exposing yourself to something entirely new, you open yourself up to new opportunities and possibilities that wouldn't otherwise be available. It provides you with the opportunity to challenge yourself, gain new skills and experiences, and find success in whatever you pursue. As humans, we are always looking to grow and evolve into something better. They may choose to work on improving their speed or agility or even to try a different sport altogether. This process helps them become well-rounded athletes and ultimately to better themselves. In the same way, people often look to improve their existing skills in order to find success in a job or career. We often find ourselves looking to do something beyond what we have already mastered or to learn a different skill. For example, someone starting out in an entry-level job may take a course, or even just read a book, to learn something new that will help them get ahead."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off. In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you \"You can do it\". This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions. Therefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either. People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Although some say \"Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\". Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself \"I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way\". Some say if \"You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow\". How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it! Others say that \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\". I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong."}]}

On one hand, extracurricular activities can give students the opportunity to explore their interests and develop valuable skills that will benefit them in the future. However, it is also important to take into account the potential drawbacks of such a requirement. In conclusion, mandating extracurricular activities could potentially offer students a range of benefits. The introduction of a new school requirement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity has far-reaching implications, both positive and negative. This can lead to frustration and a feeling that there is simply not enough time or resources to devote to the extracurricular activity. Enforcing the mandate can put an additional strain on students already faced with a skyrocketing workload. Moreover, it encourages students to form meaningful relationships with their peers, resulting in enhanced social and emotional growth. On the other hand, the mandate may place additional burden on already stressed and overbooked students, ultimately leading to feelings of resentment and disengagement. By making extracurricular activities mandatory, students are given the opportunity to try something new and develop a passion that could eventually form the basis of a future career. In this essay, I will explore the effects of a school requirement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. The primary benefit of the mandate is increased engagement and motivation among students. Yet, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks and to ensure that all students have the resources and support they need to succeed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders. Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude. Let me explain. Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation. Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. Students want to be free. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way. Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a \"extracurricular activity\". Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts. So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity. Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things. That's why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. myself for example. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there. It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a \"extracurricular activity\". I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs."}]}

This can save students money and time, as they no longer have to allocate resources on either commuting or spending hours sitting in a classroom. Distance learning also helps students streamline their study time, as they don’t have to factor in breaks for food. In conclusion, distance learning provides countless benefits for students in terms of transportation, food, and flexible activities. When it comes to transportation, distance learning removes the need for students to travel to a physical class location. This makes learning more efficient as students can focus for longer amounts of time without the interruption of regular meal times. In addition, students are given more autonomy when it comes to choosing activities outside of studies. Students can continue working for extended periods without the distraction of meals or worries about getting hungry. Additionally, students are free to take classes from anywhere in the world, allowing for great flexibility regarding learning environments. Whether it be part time jobs, sports, or other hobbies, distance learning allows students to make the most of their free time. The advantages of distance learning for students are numerous, ranging from increased transportation convenience to the freedom to choose between activities. Without the restriction of a literal school time bell telling them when to start and stop studying, students can adjust their work schedules to suit their everyday lives. It allows for a more convenient and personalized learning experience, allowing students to tailor their studies to their own needs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do. Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways. By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want. The benefits that you get does not end there. Another thing is the food. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you. There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says \"distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing\". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not."}]}

In everyday life, we utilize our creative thinking skills to help us plan for the future and solve everyday issues. Finally, imagination is used in educational stories to teach lessons that can be applied to real life scenarios. Imagination is a powerful tool that can be used to unlock limitless knowledge and drive creativity. Drawing from practical examples from everyday life, inventions in our modern world, and educational stories, this essay will show why it is important to use imagination in knowledge. In summary, imagination has proven to be an essential component in everyday life, modern inventions, and educational stories. For example, by using vivid imagery and imaginative characters, stories allow the reader to put themselves in the character's shoes, empathize with them, and learn lessons on how to best traverse a problem. First, imagination allows us to think creatively and find solutions to existing problems. For example, when faced with the dilemma of a limited budget to furnish a room, one might use their imagination to think of more cost-effective alternatives, such as purchasing furniture from second-hand stores or repurposing already owned materials. Second, imagination is an essential component in modern inventions. Many of the modern inventions we find today, such as the iPhone, couldn't have been created without engineers using their imagination to dream of a better future. By using imagination, we have been able to find creative solutions, build revolutionary inventions, and learn important lessons from educational stories. In this way, stories can successfully use imagination to teach strong lessons that can be applied to real life. For example, engineers use imagination to construct inventions that revolutionize the world."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Every time I read a book I saw it all in my head, and it was cool, and fun! Also every time I wanted to draw something, I would have to see it in my head, and see what I should draw. even if you have to write a essay, then you need to use your imagination as well. knowledge is something to see, and think about. Many people invent things, but before they make it they think about what they want to make, and they imagine what what they want. for example I once had to make a assay for my teacher, and it was about life bellow water it was pretty hard, and I had to explain what was going on in the ocean. Albert Einstein was a very smart man. its not hard to use your imagination its fun, because you can think about anything you want. That is why I agree with Albert Einstein. There are kids that get read to, and they imagine whats going on they dont just listen they think about what they hear. and it can help us too. It helped him on many things. Everyone uses there imagination there isnt knowledge without imagination. It took a while to make, but I ended up saying that people keep throwing trash in the in the ocean can you imagine how many animals, and creatures are dying every day because of that? I imagined all of it, and people should not throw trash in the ocean. Even if your making a poem then you have to think what rhymes or doesnt rhyme. Also if your teacher is explaining things to you, then you have to think about what shes saying, and think about what your going to do. he had made many things in life, and we use it till now. Even if your thinking about something then your using your imagination too. People invented cars, motorcycles, bikes, and skateboards, But before they made all those things they drew it out they took there imagination, and put it on a peace of paper. My second reason is Albert Einstein invented many things he might of failed on some, but he succeeded on many. one reason, is there is no knowledge without imagination, because your have to be open minded about things. He said \"imagination is more important than knowledge\", he made that statement because he used it to make his creations great. Imagination isnt just a picture in your head. If you are listening to music, then you are using your imagination as well. Even if you are trying to make song or some thing, then your have to imagine how the beat is gonna go, and figure out if it sounds good to you. For example if your are writing something, you have to use your imagination on it. Also there are doctors that have to see if they can save someone, they have to think and see in there head if they should get this, or that. I agree with this statement, because one there's no knowledge without imagination, secondly Albert Einstein has made many inventions and he has succeeded, and lastly you can be creative with your imagination. People had made phones all different types of phones, People have made flip phones, iPhone, and androids they all invented that, and used there minds and creativity to make all that. My last reason is to be creative with your imagination, I chose this because if your making a book you need to let the reader think, and picture the scene in there mind, or if your reading a book then you have to imagine it in your head instead of just reading it, and doing nothing."}]}
