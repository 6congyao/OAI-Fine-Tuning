Ultimately, attempting to do something beyond what you have already mastered not only helps you to grow but is also important to reaching your goals and achieving success. All of these skills are important for leading a successful life. In conclusion, attempting to do something beyond what you have already mastered can help you grow in ways that you may have never expected. This desire to take on something new can be a valuable tool to help us grow and develop. One example of this is in the world of athletics. Taking on something that you may not have done before also helps you to gain confidence in your abilities, build trust in yourself, and even to become a better problem solver. Athletes are constantly looking to take their existing skills to the next level by adding a new one. By exposing yourself to something entirely new, you open yourself up to new opportunities and possibilities that wouldn't otherwise be available. It provides you with the opportunity to challenge yourself, gain new skills and experiences, and find success in whatever you pursue. As humans, we are always looking to grow and evolve into something better. They may choose to work on improving their speed or agility or even to try a different sport altogether. This process helps them become well-rounded athletes and ultimately to better themselves. In the same way, people often look to improve their existing skills in order to find success in a job or career. We often find ourselves looking to do something beyond what we have already mastered or to learn a different skill. For example, someone starting out in an entry-level job may take a course, or even just read a book, to learn something new that will help them get ahead."

            "content": "Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off. In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you \"You can do it\". This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions. Therefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either. People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Although some say \"Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\". Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself \"I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way\". Some say if \"You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow\". How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it! Others say that \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\". I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong."
