            "content": "In conclusion, it is undeniably true that individuals who have an active ambition to strive towards their goals will become more successful than those who do not, as stated by Thomas Jefferson. He did not simply wait for his goals to come to fruition; instead, he was actively involved in every step of the creation process, from in-depth market research to detailed product testing and design. In contrast, there are those who fail to reach their dreams because they do not strive to actively pursue their goals. For example, many aspiring entrepreneurs will not risk their financial security in order to invest in their ideas, as they are not motivated to work towards their dreams. To illustrate this idea, we can consider the example of Steve Jobs: an ambitious man who sought to revolutionize the world of technology. To put it simply: having an active attitude of determination and ambition can truly bring success. Thomas Jefferson once famously declared that \"nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude\". His words have a powerful resonance in our present day, for it is clear that those who act on their dreams and goals can achieve far more than those who do not. Those who do not have a clear focus do not tend to be willing to make sacrifices or take risks to push themselves further. They will create tangible plans, allowing them to establish deadlines and strides in reaching their goals. Achieving oneâ€™s ambitions does not come easy, and for those willing to work hard, the rewards can be great. When examining individuals who actively strive to reach their ambitions, the key component is the clear focus on their objectives."

Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things Finally, be related everyday this is something special. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. Thomas Jefferson said. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something \"I need to struggle\". Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related. However noeveryone agree. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen. In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Because you always are looking for something more than one. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. But he always said this words \"one day everything is going to change\". He never stop to belived that. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament."
