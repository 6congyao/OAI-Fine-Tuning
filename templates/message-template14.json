In conclusion, while educators and students view long summer vacations differently, both can benefit from this extended break. Summer is a special season for both students and educators. These activities provide students with valuable experience and potentially a source of income. It is also a period for catch-up work, such as lesson planning and grading, which may not be possible during the school year when teaching time takes priority. Students generally enjoy summer vacation because it's a break from schoolwork and everyday obligations, allowing them to take some time for themselves. Furthermore, the summer offers the perfect opportunity to pursue an extra activity, like an internship, or a summer job. On one hand, many students look forward to long summer vacation as a chance to relax, have fun, and explore new activities; many educators, however, view summer vacation as a well-deserved break from the classroom that allows them to spend more time away from the pressures of their jobs. For me, summer vacation has always been a wonderful opportunity to pursue creative projects and spend quality time with family and friends. During this period, students have adequate time for leisure activities like visiting friend’s house, going shopping, playing games, etc. Students use the time to explore and try new things, while educators are able to recharge and catch up on tasks that didn’t happen during the school year. On the other hand, some educators believe that summer vacation is a chance to recharge and find a better balance between their professional and personal lives."

Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I couln't do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us would't provide the same amount of aventures. More over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldn't make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. Most student enjoy summer vacations, but some educators believe that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig. In conclusion, summer vacations is the best, and it never has to change the aumount of days that they give to us, is prefectly the days that we all need to refresh from school and things that happened over the year. Summer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. What educators don't see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. It can sound exagerate but that wouldn't be much time to us for do our sumer change. First of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the \"suffer\" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the one's who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. I beliebe that we things shouldn't change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students who's choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school. On the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times don't remenber thing that I sow the year before. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year."
