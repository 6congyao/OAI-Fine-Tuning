When setting goals to a higher level, there are clear benefits that can be seen compared to setting goals to a low level. Goals provide clarity, set expectations and can help keep someone on track and focused on their end goal. For many people who want to achieve something significant in life, setting goals is a crucial step in the effort of reaching that success. Furthermore, challenging goals can provide someone with a variety of intellectual, physical, and emotional experiences that will be beneficial in the long run. Reaching higher level objectives can also open up the possibility to more, as putting extra effort into a task or achieving a goal that seems extreme can open up myriad of other opportunities that one may not have had access to before. Doing so can help one reach to the top without sacrificing too much and experiencing the most benefit. In this way, one can find growth in all aspects and gain knowledge that will remain with them for a lifetime. Moreover, if the goal is too far out of reach, it can lead to a sense of failure and an unwillingness to keep striving towards the goal. Overall, setting goals to a higher level provides one with more growth and a greater sense of success compared to setting goals at a lower level. When setting these objectives, it is important to consider the level of difficulty and the expected growth one will experience. Achieving more difficult goals can not only provide a sense of success and pride, but also can give validation to progress made and a sense of growth. However, it is important to note that this type of growth comes with a certain cost. Setting higher level goals can require extra focus, time, energy, and other resources that may have a financial or emotional consequence. On the other hand, it is important to keep a sense of balance when setting goals as to not end up overwhelmed or taken aback if the goal is out of reach. Growth in terms of experiences, awareness, and knowedge."

However, aiming high and failing gives you a life-longing experience by having the chance to improve your mistakes. In my opinion, I agree with Michelangelo's quote; when people aim too low, they are preventing themselves to have learning experiences. When attempting again, you will have gained the knowledge to do so. In conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low and achieving it is far worse than aiming high and failing. Although one may fail while aiming high, you will gain experience and knowledge from the situation. To begin with, growth comes with attempting to accomplish new things out of your comfort zone. Being the valedictorian comes with great results such as getting into a better college or even just feeling better about yourself. The famous artist Michelangelo once said, \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark\". His quote implies that completing a low goal is far worse that failure. When setting you aim high, it improves you as a person and helps with your own growth. Not to mention, aiming high for a goal is possible when you have the right mentality. When you aim high, the results are more motivating than when going for a goal set low. Instead, they believe that going for a goal set too high is worse as it means it will come with failure. Failing is essential to the learning process as it gives you a chance to better yourself to prevent future mistakes. By setting goals too low, we are preventing ourselves to grow and improve. You can learn about your interests and hobbies, or even new ideas and thoughts that come to mind. For instance, when working towards a goal, it comes with finding your true self. If you put your mind to it, belive in yourself, and work hard towards it you will be able to accomplish any goal. Furthermore, failing at achieving a goal provides experience. By setting goals to a higher level, we can gain experience and knowledge that comes with the path to achievement. For the fact that we need to grow as a person, we can not always stay in our comfort zone. For instance, when achieving to graduate high school, one may aim to graduate as valedictorian. In order to succeed the next time you attempt again, you can improve your mistakes. When you set your aim high, it assists with finding out what you are truly capable of. Because aiming high comes with better resluts, it can serve as motivation to completing a goal. On the other hand, when you aim for a low mark, there is no learning lesson you may gain. However, some people believe nothing is wrong with setting your aim low. While always staying in your comfort zone, aiming low, you will be confining yourself, which prevents you from improvement. This knowledge you have accumulated from this certain situation, will be useful if applied to other life problems. When you fail, you can use that situation to understand where you went wrong. In order for growth and improvement, one must be required to step out off their comfort zone."
