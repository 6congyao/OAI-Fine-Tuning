There are many ways to achieve the important goal of remaining true to oneself. Being kind and respectful of different backgrounds and beliefs can help a person feel connected to others. It can be easy to fall into the trap of believing that we must fit these outside expectations in order to be accepted. Ultimately, it is important to recognize the value of being yourself and the benefits it will bring. Most importantly, it is essential to be mindful of one's thought process so they can focus on self-love and acceptance instead of internalizing any unwanted pressures from society. However, it is important to know that no one should have to change who they are to please someone else. One of the best things a person can do is to surround themselves with supportive people who will accept them for who they are. Social media, magazines, television, and other modern forms of communication reinforce ideas about who we should be, telling us one thing yet pressuring us to act another way. By maintaining an attitude of self-love and acceptance, one can develop the strength to be themselves even in the face of other people's opinions. Being yourself is essential for good mental health. There is great strength and courage in being true to oneself and overcoming the pressures of society. An individual should also be mindful of the thoughts they have and how they perceive others. It means having the courage to stand up for what you believe in and to be yourself even when it's hard. It can be difficult to remain true to oneself in a world where there are constant forces trying to make you something else."

If you help them and they accept your help, they will be thankful to you because you help them a lot and you was with them, when nobody wasn't. At the end of your days you will be really thankful to you because you live life the way that you are, not the way that others wanted you to be. It was just obstacles that maked your life more stressful and harder but you did it. For example the LGBT community get a lot of hate, judge and bad things from other people that is not part of it. You got all the things that you wanted and the most important was, to be yourself. People in this world just talk about others without thinking the pain that they can cause by saying just a few simple words. They will never be satisfied, they will judge you, they will talk bad things about you, but at the end it's just a obstacle that the life put in your way, so you can surpass it and finally find yourself and be how you are. To be yourself in this actual world it's difficult for some people because sometimes they don't support the judges from other people and most of this people just decide to end with their life. You will think in all the things that you have to supported and achieved just to get your goal, to be who you are and at end you will knew that it wasn't hard. Other example is the people from other country that travel to another, there are people that are racist and make people feel that they are from another world, when they are actually they same, the only thing that change is the culture and language. To be yourself in a world that is contantly trying to make you something else is one of the most important things that people have to achieve, to live the life better because you will never progress in your emotional life if you don't make people accept the way that you are. For teenagers to be theirselves is most difficult because they are in a young age and sometimes they don't really know how they are or how they want to be, and when they finally find it, the hard part is coming. You have to fight to achieve this because life is better if you do it, is better if you don't care about others comments, you will be more stronger than before if you fight with all this situations. You will be more happy and will have a great life if you are yourself, you will be more certain about your opinions, decisions and actions. Then for older people, most of them don't care what people say about them, I have seen a lot of older people that dress and make to their selves what they want and I really like to see them because it makes me to be less insecure about myself, they just make me think a lot. Live the life by showing how you are, the opinion of other people doesn't have to make you more insecure or make you think that if you do this or other things you will get judged or hated. To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment because at the day of today there's a lot people that doesn't want to accept the way that you are or you want to be."
