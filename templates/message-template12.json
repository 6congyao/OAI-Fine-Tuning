            "content": "It can also be beneficial to identify and nurture your passions and engage in meaningful activities. Indeed, ‘being yourself’ in less than ideal conditions can be the ‘greatest accomplishment’ of all. And those who are seen as ‘different’ – whether because of their personal preferences, physical appearance, or anything else – often have to battle against negative stereotypes in order to remain true to themselves. Despite these difficulties, however, it is possible to be yourself, even in difficult situations. It is a difficult but ultimately rewarding feat, one which is worthy of celebration and acknowledgement. The struggles of being yourself can often be compounded for immigrant populations, teenagers, and those who are considered ‘different’. By remaining true to your authentic self, you can stay confident and maintain your integrity, even when facing adversity. In a world filled with expectations, it can be difficult to remain true to oneself. For example, immigrant families often have to deal with different cultures, expectations, and norms, which can make it hard for them to stay true to their identity and beliefs. For example, it can be beneficial to surround oneself with people who can support, encourage and motivate you to be your true self, free from judgement. Through these means, it is possible to stick to your values and be your true self in spite of any pressure to conform. Teenagers, in particular, frequently have to face peer pressure to conform to certain standards and ideals, which again can make it difficult to be their authentic selves."

I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly. Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong. Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. I am agree with the Emerson's statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself. it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it."
