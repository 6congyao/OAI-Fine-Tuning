Fortunately, technology does have the potential to be used responsibly. Additionally, too much time spent on devices is linked to an increase in feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress. Technology can also impact our personal relationships. By recognizing the potential risks of technology and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure technology continues to be an asset to our lives. Additionally, setting boundaries for yourself with regard to social media use can help foster healthier relationships. Prolonged exposure to blue light emitted by electronic devices can disrupt our natural circadian rhythms, causing a range of issues including insomnia, fatigue, and mood disturbances. While the advances made possible by technology have been beneficial for many, they have also made it easier for us to become over-reliant on digital resources and lose our natural connection with people and our environment. One of the biggest dangers of technology is its potential to negatively affect our physical and mental health. Limiting our exposure to blue light by avoiding screens at night, and keeping dedicated tech-free time is one way to ensure technology has limited negative impacts. Technology has become an integral part of our lives, both in the workplace and in our personal lives."

Finally, the obsession that technology are creating is very worrying, many kids don't do the homeworks, the students text in class and do not put attention, other persons driving texting causing accidents. I think that technology is bad because with technology we can do many thinks, but some people use technology for hacks, steal acounts and cheat persons. First, some people said that the technology is important in this era, because is more easy to do many thinks, for example, search specific information more fast. To do homeworks or company works with more information and explanations make projects, glide planes or to find books and work without think a lot. Second, the technology is very important to some people, because many times they used it to do they works and make some project, the technology in this era provoked many wrong thinks, it created many electronic thinks that are advanced. However, the technology caused many problems, the people are using the electronic thinks a lot, the cellphone, video games etc. Jonh once said, Technology had positive and negative effects on people's life, people complete many tasks without having contact with others. Today in this era the technology are advancing and provoking that people do not learn and sometimes it cause the death, persons use technology sometimes to hacks acounts and steal informations, photos or they publish inappropriate photos in they acounts causing bullyng or making the person feels bad. people have to put their own limit to control technology when it cause problems.
