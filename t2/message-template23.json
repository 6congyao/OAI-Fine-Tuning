            "content": "In today's society, it is evident that certain individuals enjoy more privileges than others, leading to the marginalization of certain groups based on race, ethnicity, and social class. This essay aims to shed light on the issue of racial discrimination and its impact on individuals, particularly within the criminal justice system. Drawing inspiration from Bryan Stevenson's book, \"Just Mercy,\" and recent events such as the tragic killing of George Floyd, it becomes clear that racial injustice persists and demands urgent attention.\nOne personal encounter with racial discrimination involved witnessing an African American woman being denied entry into a restaurant for unknown reasons. This incident left me feeling anxious and highlighted the need to address racial discrimination. No individual should be subjected to mistreatment based on their race, emphasizing the significance of combating racial discrimination in the modern world.\nThe criminal justice system, designed to protect and serve all individuals, often fails to be inclusive and fair. Minorities and those who do not conform to societal norms frequently face unequal treatment within this system. Stevenson's book highlights the vulnerability of certain groups and his efforts to bring justice to those unjustly incarcerated. It is evident that the system is inherently biased against minorities, leading to unnecessary suffering without justifiable cause.\nThe killing of George Floyd serves as a prominent example of the systemic racial injustice prevalent in society. The footage of his murder evoked feelings of pain and rage, highlighting the long-standing mistreatment of Black individuals. The powerlessness experienced by witnesses and George himself underscores the urgent need for action against racial injustice.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has taught us that being non-racist is insufficient; we must actively become anti-racist. Silence can be interpreted as consent, necessitating the fulfillment of our moral obligations to those suffering from racial injustice. This entails engaging in meaningful conversations, supporting relevant causes, being conscious consumers, and advocating for policy changes. Stevenson's book echoes this call for rational consideration of each criminal case, the elimination of bias, and the provision of assistance to those in need.\nThe events of the past year have made it impossible to ignore the suffering endured by marginalized communities. We are duty-bound to respond, as ignorance and inaction have no place in addressing racial injustice. Empathy must be combined with action to effect change. Despite the prevalence of recorded incidents, law enforcement personnel are rarely held accountable for excessive use of force. The lack of accountability has sparked a widespread demand for justice, emphasizing the urgency of addressing racial injustice.\nThe persistence of racial discrimination in modern society necessitates immediate action. By sharing personal experiences, reflecting on Bryan Stevenson's book, and examining recent events, it becomes evident that racial injustice remains a pressing issue. It is our responsibility to unlock our empathy and translate it into meaningful action. Only through collective efforts can we dismantle systemic racism and create a more just and equitable society for all."

            "content": "It is no secret that some members of society have more privileges than others. People are marginalized based on their race, ethnicity, and social class. My experience with unjustly treated people was when I saw how an African American woman was not allowed to enter a restaurant due to some unknown reasons. This was a terrible experience as I felt anxious about what was happening in the restaurant. I think people should not be treated badly because of their race. Racial discrimination should be a problem in the modern world.\nThis minor case suggests the greater problem that is unjustly treating people in the context of the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system in the United States is designed to protect and serve everyone. This concept should be inclusive of all races, genders, and other identifying features. It happens more than what the news channels may bring to light, although it should not. Minorities and people who do not meet society’s “norms” are frequently subjected to unequal treatment by those charged with protecting them. In the book, Stevenson writes about groups of people who are vulnerable to being victimized by the system and how he helped people in prison to bring them justice. It can be said that the system is inherently biased toward minorities, and it makes people suffer without any significant justification.\nA prominent example of this is the case of George Floyd. When I first viewed the footage of George Floyd’s killing, I felt a wave of pain and rage run through my body. Not because I was surprised or outraged because Black women and men have been occurring since long before I was born; rather, I felt impotent.\nThat someone in a position to protect and safeguard chose to do the exact opposite and murder someone so openly and publicly. It’s the same hopelessness that the spectators who witnessed Floyd’s murder must have felt, and it’s the same helplessness that George must have felt as he screamed in his final minutes. The kind of powerlessness that makes you want to take action.\nOne of the lessons of the Black Lives Matter movement is that being non-racist is not enough; we must all utilize our voices to be anti-racist. Because silence might be construed as consent, we all must fulfill our moral obligations to those who are suffering as a result of the battle. That doesn’t just imply a performative social media post; it also entails asking ourselves how we might assist. We can help the cause by having dialogues with friends and family, giving, being socially conscious shoppers, or writing to elected authorities about adopting policies that will result in change. This is what exactly Stevenson described in his book, calling for rational consideration of each criminal case, not being biased, and helping people.\nWe can no longer turn our backs on what has happened in the last year. The suffering of the less fortunate is documented and disseminated for all to see. We are obligated to respond because there is no room for ignorance or inaction. The vehicle for change will be our ability to unlock our empathy for others and combine it with action. Even though many of these deaths were captured on film, police personnel is rarely arrested, prosecuted, or convicted for excessive use of force. A popular clamor for justice has erupted in response to the perceived lack of accountability."
