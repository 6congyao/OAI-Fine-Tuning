Lastly, technology has had a profound effect on our happiness. In conclusion, it is obvious that while technology has an array of positives, it has also caused many serious and long-lasting negative effects on people's lives. Ironically, the tools that connect us have caused many of us to become disconnected from those around us. In terms of knowledge, technology has made valuable information available to all, but has also caused a decrease in analytical and critical thinking skills. Oftentimes, people are so consumed with technology that they displace their relationships with real people. Culture is the most significantly affected; technology has created a more homogenous and globalized society in which different cultures can easily interact and exchange ideas in ways never before possible. The advancement of technology has caused many negative impacts on people's lives, ranging from cultural, social, and emotional issues to intellectual ones. This has many positive effects, but has also caused many cultures to feel homogenized or to disappear altogether. When it comes to communication, technology is largely responsible for both good and bad. With the ease of access to information, many people no longer take the time to carefully analyze and reflect on issues. Furthermore, technology has had a detrimental effect on curiosity. While technology has a vast array of benefits, it has the potential to lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety when misused. On the one hand, technology has made it easier than ever to connect with people from around the world, but this has also caused a reliance on screens and keyboards as opposed to face-to-face interaction. From cultural homogenization and the displacement of real-world communication to decreased curiosity and overall happiness, it is important to remember the importance of managing technology use responsibly and proactively."

Some people think that technology is a better way to express themselves. The Negative Effects Of The Technology On People's Lives. Technology helps people to preform many things hence, classes online, shop and communicate with others. Example, My cousin is in the middle school he played Fourtnite everyday. Also technology had changed our style of lives; People used to visit parks to talk with other. This stores are on sale of everything to close right away because Fewer people visit this stores. Now everything had changed due to this issue. One reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that now some stores closed because people do not shop in this stores anymore. However technology limited us to express our ideas with no need of a cell phone device . When the teacher ask them questions related to the topic, they do not know what to answer due to the technology. In the other hand Some people will argue about technology has positive effects on our style of lives. He goes to sleep late, had bad grades and he wake up late for school. However, I had seen some students who used their cellphone during classes. Amazon has a strong impact of sales in the world, Their sales are more high than any other stores. I believe that the life is so short to waste. In the final analyses technology will keep going to destroy our cultures. I believed that technology has negative effects on people's lives because people have a limitation of a human contact due to the use of technology. Technology limited the develop of ideas.Technology limited our communication, our knowledge, our curiosity, and our happiness. She was saying that sometimes our lives depend on a cell device, but not all the time. When I did not understand some difficult words I used Google translated, so technology helped us sometime. They have this issue due to the use of technology. Local store is about to close because people prefer to stay at home and buy online. My point of view is that what she told me was true because I came to United Stated of America since 2016; I was not be able to understand or speak to others. Their sales had exceed on online store than in the located stores. Also it had destroyed our culture. Technology helps us to communicate with our families and friends. However, there are to many ways such as painting, drawing, playing even dancing. Example I am a member of a dance class, my teacher was talking about this problem with technology. Children do not read books or have fun like in the past. Some people prefer to buy their materials or clothes online stores as Amazon. Children want to stay at home playing with their laptops. He always is with his cell phone playing. My point of view is technology have a really negative effect on us because it had changed us, our world. He does not read any book and neither go outside to play. Additionally people who work in this stores are going to have a layoff due to this matter. Another reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that some places are empty namely: Parks, lakes, and malls. everything in this world is going to be different. Students are distracted with their cell phone at schools. It limited the growth of children because, they do not want to go outside to play with their friends. People will not go outside at all, to buy, to have fun, or to spend time with their families. In fact this generation do not read books or magazine because of the technology."
