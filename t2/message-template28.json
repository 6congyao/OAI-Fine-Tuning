            "content": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a pivotal aspect of modern business strategy, influencing not only a company's reputation but also its financial performance, investor relations, and long-term sustainability. CSR refers to the efforts made by corporations to manage their business processes in a way that produces an overall positive impact on society. This encompasses a wide range of activities, including environmental conservation efforts, ethical labor practices, community engagement, and philanthropy. The ethical considerations and agency costs involved in implementing CSR initiatives play a significant role in shaping a company's approach to CSR and its outcomes. Through the cases of Wells Fargo and Nike, we can explore how CSR practices influence a company's reputation, investor relations, and overall success, and discuss the balance between profit-making and ethical behavior in the context of modern commercial businesses.\nThe ethical considerations in CSR revolve around the moral obligations of corporations to their stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the environment. These obligations often extend beyond legal requirements, challenging companies to prioritize long-term societal well-being over short-term profit maximization. However, implementing CSR initiatives can lead to agency costs, which are expenses incurred when there is a conflict of interest between the company's management (agents) and its shareholders (principals). Managers might pursue CSR activities that align with their personal values or enhance their reputation, potentially at the expense of shareholder value. This tension underscores the importance of aligning CSR strategies with business objectives to ensure that ethical considerations enhance rather than detract from a company's performance.\nWells Fargo's fake accounts scandal, where employees created millions of unauthorized bank accounts to meet sales targets, is a stark example of the consequences of neglecting CSR. The scandal damaged the bank's reputation, eroded customer trust, and led to billions in fines and settlements. This case highlights the ethical considerations of CSR, specifically the importance of ethical business practices and transparency. Wells Fargo's failure to prioritize these aspects of CSR resulted in significant financial losses and a damaged brand image, underscoring the potential costs of neglecting CSR.\nConversely, Nike's journey from being criticized for poor labor practices to becoming a leader in sustainable business practices illustrates the positive impact of effective CSR on a company's reputation and performance. In the 1990s, Nike faced widespread backlash over conditions in its overseas factories. In response, Nike implemented comprehensive CSR initiatives, including improving labor practices, adopting sustainable materials, and reducing its carbon footprint. These efforts not only improved Nike's reputation but also led to innovations that enhanced its competitiveness and appeal to socially conscious consumers. Nike's experience demonstrates how well-executed CSR strategies can transform challenges into opportunities for business improvement and differentiation.\nThe balance between profit-making and ethical behavior is a central challenge for modern commercial businesses. While CSR initiatives can involve significant upfront costs and complex ethical considerations, they also offer opportunities for long-term value creation. Companies that successfully integrate CSR into their core business strategies can enhance their reputation, foster customer loyalty, attract and retain talent, and mitigate risks. This, in turn, can lead to improved financial performance and shareholder value over time.\nIn conclusion, the cases of Wells Fargo and Nike illustrate the profound impact of CSR on business performance, reputation, and investor relations. Ethical considerations and agency costs are critical factors in shaping a company's CSR strategy and outcomes. By effectively balancing profit-making with ethical behavior, companies can not only fulfill their social responsibilities but also secure a competitive advantage in today's increasingly conscientious market."

            "content": "A commercial business operates by increasing or maintaining profits. However, one of the agency costs is the excessive pre-requestive. This expense allows the contractor to get more, but does not affect the well-being of investors. Shirking of the company’s top management also creates agency costs, as it reduces the productivity of management and creates additional costs for the founders. Therefore, the earnings of other employees may decrease in this regard. In such a situation, a business must consider the ethics of its behavior.\nCorporate business requires companies to take full responsibility for how the achievement of their goals affects the world around them. Consumers, investors and employees of companies are aware of the possibilities of modern corporations (Bansal et al., 2021). In this regard, it is necessary to direct them not only to making a profit, but also to improving the life of society as a whole and developing human capital responsibility. The enterprise is obliged to carry out actions aimed at improving the condition of society, and not at its deterioration (Hoffman, 2018). The implementation of corporate social responsibility of the organization also includes responsibility to employees: the provision of an additional social package, which includes the formation of a pension system, medical insurance and recreation.\nThe ethical attitude includes the sensational case of Wells Fargo, one of the largest US banking holdings. In 2016, about 2 million credit cards issued without the knowledge of customers were discovered, the bank was fined $ 185 million, and the management fired about 1,000 employees. Investors were dissatisfied with the fact that the bank had ceased to be reliable and lost confidence in the eyes of customers, and the public considered the real culprits of what had happened not to junior employees, but to top managers of the company. The profits of the company demonstrated a decline during this period.\nOn the other hand, Nike is deeply convinced that it is possible to implement more sustainable practices in all areas of the company. To reduce the carbon footprint of Nike.com in the US, in 2020 the sports giant announced a partnership with environmental investment fund EFM. With the help of Nike, the foundation was able to plant more than 100 square kilometers of forest plantations to absorb carbon from the Earth’s atmosphere. Proper management and professional tree care increase the amount of recycled substances on Nike plantations by 30%. At the same, the revenue of the company kept on almost the same level as during the previous years due to increasing costs. However, the business maintained a reputation in the eyes of its customers.\nIn conclusion, currently, many companies pay considerable attention to compliance with the principles of corporate social responsibility. This is based on the fact that it is the observance of the principles of social responsibility that allows enterprises to improve their performance, both economic and social performance. On the one hand, corporate social responsibility is seen as an essential element of the competition strategy. On the other hand, corporate social responsibility is a consequence of the ethical behavior of an organization in the market, which is associated with the attitude towards the subjects of the external and internal environment or with an approach that takes into account three main areas (ecology, economics, sociology) as a factor of sustainable development."
